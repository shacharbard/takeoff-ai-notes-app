# Frontend Instructions
Follow these instructions to create new frontend components.

## Guidelines


### Project Structure

- The components folder is at the root of the project.
- Please put all components that you create in the components folder.
- Do not create any new components folders, just use the existing one.  
- Please group similar components in the same folder within the components folder.
- All types are going to come from the table schema found in the `db/schema` files.

### Server Components

- Please use server components to fetch data and pass the data to the client components.


### Client Components

- Client components need 'use client' at the top of the file. So any time
- Always use client compnents for user interaction and other client-specific logic.
